\begin{abstract}
 Let $k$ be an arbitrary field. In this paper we show that in the linear case ($\Phi=\rA_\ell$, $\ell \geq 4$) and even orthogonal case ($\Phi = \rD_\ell$, $\ell\geq 7$, $\mathrm{char}(k)\neq 2$) the unstable functor $\mathrm{K}_2(\Phi, -)$ possesses the $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariance property, i.\,e. $\K_2(\Phi, R[t]) = \K_2(\Phi, R)$ for regular rings $R$ containing $k$. As a consequence, it can be represented in the unstable $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy category $\mathcal{H}^{\mathbb{A}^1}_{k}$ as the fundamental group of the simply-connected Chevalley--Demazure group scheme $\mathrm{G}_\mathrm{sc}(\Phi,-)$. Our invariance result can be considered as the $\K_2$-analogue of the geometric case of Bass--Quillen conjecture. We also show for a semilocal regular $k$-algebra $A$ that $\K_2(\Phi, A)$ embeds as a subgroup into $\K^\mathrm{M}_2(\mathrm{Frac}(A))$.

\section{Introduction}
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with a unit and $\Phi$ be an irreducible root system of rank $\geq 2$.
Recall from~\cite{St71,St78} that to this data one can associate two objects: the simply-connected Chevalley--Demazure group scheme $\mathrm{G}_\mathrm{sc}(\Phi, R)$ and the Steinberg group $\St(\Phi, R)$, which is a certain group defined by means of generators and relations, see~\cref{sec:main-results}. These group fit into the exact sequence
\begin{equation} \label{eq:main-exactSeq} \begin{tikzcd} \K_2(\Phi, R) \ar[hookrightarrow]{r} & \St(\Phi, R) \ar{r}{\pi} & \mathrm{G}_\mathrm{sc}(\Phi, R) \ar[twoheadrightarrow]{r} & \K_1(\Phi, R), \end{tikzcd} \end{equation}
the rightmost and the leftmost terms of which are called by M.~Stein the {\it unstable $\K$-functors modeled on Chevalley groups}, see~\cite{St78}. The aim of the present paper is to show the following 

\begin{theorem}[The $\K_2$-analogue of Lindel--Popescu theorem] \label{theorem:LP-for-K2}
Let $k$ be an arbitrary field and $R$ be a regular ring containing $k$. Let $\Phi$ be either $\rA_\ell$ for $\ell\geq4$, or $\rD_\ell$ for $\ell\geq 7$. In the latter case assume additionally that the characteristic of $k$ is not $2$. Then $\K_2(\Phi,\,R[t])\cong\K_2(\Phi,\,R).$
\end{theorem} 
Recall that the classical Lindel--Popescu theorem for projective modules settles the the geometric case of the Bass--Quillen conjecture, see~\cite{Li81},~\cite{Po85}.
An exposition of D.~Popescu's result can also be found in~\cite{Sw98}. Our result, thus, can be considered as the solution to the $\K_2$-analogue of the geometric case of the Bass--Quillen conjecture.
Recall also that the $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariance for the unstable $\K_1$-functor modeled on $\Phi$ of rank $\geq 2$ has been established in~\cite{Abe83} and has been subsequently generalized to isotropic reductive groups, cf.~\cite[Theorem~1.3]{Sta14}, \cite[Theorem~1.1]{Sta20}.

When $R=k$ is a field the assertion of~\cref{theorem:LP-for-K2} is known from~\cite{Re75} for all $\Phi$ (see Korollar of~Satz~1). Also if $\Phi = \rA_\ell$ and $\ell \geq \mathrm{max}(4, \mathrm{dim}(R) + 2)$ the assertion of~\cref{theorem:LP-for-K2} follows from the main result of~\cite{Tu83}.

The assertion of~\cref{theorem:LP-for-K2} is likely to remain true for all $\Phi$ of rank $\geq 3$ without any assumptions on the characteristic of $k$. It is false for $\Phi$ of rank $2$, however, see~\cite{We12}. The bottleneck in our proof which leads to the restrictive assumptions $\ell\geq 7$ and $\mathrm{char}(k)\neq 2$ in the case $\Phi=\rD_\ell$ is the orthogonal Horrocks theorem \cite[Theorem~1]{LS20}. In the future papers we plan to address this issue and obtain an improved Horrocks theorem for all simply-laced $\Phi$ containing $\rA_4$ without the invertibility of $2$ assumption.

The principal tool used in the proof of~\cref{theorem:LP-for-K2} is~\cref{lpb}, which gives a sufficient condition for a general group-valued functor to be $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant. A key ingredient in the  proof of~\cref{lpb}, in turn, is a recent result of I.~Panin, see~\cite[Theorem~2.5]{Pa19}. One of the axioms appearing in the statement of~\cref{lpb} is the so-called {\it weak affine Nisnevich excision property} for Steinberg groups. The verification of this property for simply-laced Steinberg groups is another new result of the paper, see~\cref{glueing}. Unlike M.~Tulenbaev, who used the technique of van der Kallen's ``another presentation'' in the proof of the weaker Zariski excision property~\cite[Proposition~1.4]{Tu83}, in our proof we use the new technique of pro-groups introduced by the third-named author in~\cite{Vor1} (see also~\cite{LSV20}). %V20?

As a corollary of~\cref{theorem:LP-for-K2}, we show that the M.~Stein's group $\K_2(\Phi, R)$ can be interpreted as the fundamental group of the Chevalley--Demazure group scheme in the unstable $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy category $\mathcal{H}^{\mathbb{A}^1}_{k}$ of Morel and Voevodsky~\cite{MV99}.
\begin{corollary} \label{cor:motivic-pi1} Let $R$ and $\Phi$ be as in~\cref{theorem:LP-for-K2} and assume addtionally that $R$ is Noetherian of finite Krull dimension. Then one has \[\pi_1^{\mathbb{A}^1}(\Gsc(\Phi, -))(R) := \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{H}^{\mathbb{A}^1}_{k,*}}(S^1 \wedge (\mathrm{Spec}(R))_+, \Gsc(\Phi, -)) = \K_2(\Phi, R).\]
\end{corollary}
The above result is analogous to the computation of $\pi_0$ of an isotropic reductive group due to A.~Stavrova, see~\cite[Theorem~5.5]{Sta20}. The analogue of~\cref{cor:motivic-pi1} in the broader context of reductive groups of isotropic rank $\geq 2$ (albeit only when $R = k$ is an infinite field) has also been obtained in~\cite{VW16}.

In addition to~\cref{theorem:LP-for-K2} the proof of~\cref{cor:motivic-pi1} relies on the computation of the fundamental group of the simplicial group $\St(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet])$, see \cref{prop:pi1-StDelta}. This computation can be considered as a more precise version of the calculation presented in~\cite[Proposition~3.2]{VW16} in the setting of Chevalley groups.

The method of the proof of~\cref{lpb} allows one to obtain the following assertion for the functor $\K_2(\Phi, R)$ as a byproduct, cf. e.\,g. with~\cite[Theorem~1.2]{Sta20}.
\begin{theorem} \label{theorem:Gersten} Let $\Phi$ and $k$ be as in~\cref{theorem:LP-for-K2} and let $A$ be an arbitrary semi-local regular domain containing $k$. Then the canonical map $\K_2(\Phi, A) \to \K_2(\Phi, \mathrm{Frac}(A))$ is injective. \end{theorem}

Combining the above result with the classical Matsumoto theorem~\cite[Theorem~5.10]{Ma69} one can show that under the assumptions of~\cref{theorem:LP-for-K2} $\K_2(\Phi, A)$ embeds into the Milnor $\K_2$-group $\K_2^\mathrm{M}(\mathrm{Frac}(A))$.

Using the fact that $\K_1(\rD_\ell, k[t_1,\ldots, t_n]) = 1$ and the second homology of the elementary subgroup of $\mathrm{Spin}_{2\ell}(R)$ coincides with $\K_2(\rD_\ell, R)$ for all commutative $R$ and $\ell\geq 5$ (see e.\,g.~\cite[Corollary~5.4]{St71}, \cite[Theorem~1]{LS17}) we can obtain yet another corollary of~\cref{theorem:LP-for-K2}.
\begin{corollary}
For $k$ with $\mathrm{char}(k)\neq 2$, $\ell \geq 7$ and $n\geq 0$ one has $\mathrm H_2(\mathrm{Spin}_{2\ell}(k[t_1,\ldots,t_n]),\,\mathbb Z\big) = \K^\mathrm{M}_2(k)$.
\end{corollary}

\section{General formalism}
For a commutative ring $k$ we denote by $\catname{Alg}_k$ the category of commutative unital $k$-algebras (not neccessarily of finite type). In the statement of~\cref{lpb}, which is the main result of this section, $k$ will be assumed to be a field. However, some of the intermediate steps in the proof of~\cref{lpb} can be obtained for $k=\ZZ$, so for the sake of greater generality we make no blanket assumption that $k$ is a field.  

For a commutative ring $R$ and an element $a\in R$ we denote by $\lambda_a$ the homomorphism of principal localization $R \to R_a$. Similarly, we denote by $\lambda_P$ the homomorphism $R \to R_P = (R\setminus P)^{-1}R$ of localization in a prime ideal $P \trianglelefteq R$. Notice that if $a$ is nilpotent then $R_a$ is the zero ring (which we also consider as an object of $\catname{Alg}_k$). 

Let $A$ be an $R$-algebra, $f\in R[t]$ and $a \in A$. We denote by $ev_t(a)$ (or just $ev(a)$ when $t$ is clear from the context) the unique $R$-algebra homomorphism $R[t] \to A$ mapping $t$ to $a$. For a functor $K \colon \catname{Alg}_k \to \catname{Grp}$ and an element $g \in K(R[t])$ we often shorten the notation for the element $K(ev(a))(g)$ to just $g(a)$.

\begin{df}\label{df:NK}
Let $K$ be a functor $\catname{Alg}_k \to \catname{Grp}$.
Denote by $NK(R)$ the kernel of the homomorphism $K(R[t]) \to K(R)$ induced by the homomorphism of evaluation at $t=0$. It is clear that $K(R[t]) \cong NK(R) \rtimes K(R)$ and $NK$ is also a functor $\catname{Alg}_k \to \catname{Grp}$. If $K(R[t])$ is abelian then $K(R[t]) \cong NK(R) \oplus K(R)$ and our definition agrees with~\cite[Def.~III.3.3]{Kbook}.
\end{df}

For a commutative ring $R$ and $a \in R$ consider the following commutative square:
  \begin{equation} \label{M-sq} \begin{tikzcd} R \ltimes t R_a[t] \ar{r}{l} \ar{d}[swap]{e} & R_a[t] \ar{d}{ev(0)} \\ R \ar{r}{\lambda_a} & R_a. \end{tikzcd}\end{equation}
  The ring $R \ltimes tR_a[t]$ can be defined either via the semidirect product construction (see e.\,g. \cite[Definition~3.2]{S15}) or as the pullback of~\eqref{M-sq}.
  It is also clear that~\eqref{M-sq} is a Milnor square, see~\cite[Example~I.2.6]{Kbook}.

Now suppose that $k$ is a field. Following Swan we say that a $k$-algebra $R$ is {\it geometrically regular} (over $k$), if for any finite field extension $E$ of $k$ the ring $R\otimes_kE$ is regular (cf.~\cite[p.~137]{Sw98}). In particular, a geometrically regular algebra is noetherian. If $k$ is perfect then a $k$-algebra $R$ is geometrically regular over $k$ if and only if it is regular.

The following result gives a sufficient condition for a functor $K$ to be $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant, cf. e.\,g. with~\cite[Proposition~2.2]{AHW20}.
\begin{theorem} \label{lpb}
 Let $k$ be a field.
 Suppose that a functor $K \colon \catname{Alg}_k \to \catname{Grp}$ satisfies the following axioms:
 \begin{enumerate}[label=\textnormal{(A\arabic*)}]
  \item \label{CFC} {\it $K$ is finitary}, i.\,e. commutes with filtered colimits.
  \item \label{DP} For a $k$-algebra $R$ and $a \in R$ consider the diagram obtained from~\eqref{M-sq} by applying $K$. Then the homomorphism $\Ker(K(e)) \to NK(R_a)$ between the kernels of vertical arrows is injective.
  \item \label{LPP} {\it $K$ satisfies weak affine Nisnevich excision for domains.} By this we mean the following. Let $\iota \colon B \hookrightarrow A$ be an injective homomorphism of domains contained in $\catname{Alg}_k$ such that $\mathrm{Spec}(A)\to\mathrm{Spec}(B)$ is an {\'e}tale morphism of affine schemes. Let $h$ be an element of $B$ not invertible in $A$ such that $\iota$ induces an isomorphism $B / hB \cong A / \iota(h)A$. Consider the following commutative square: \[\begin{tikzcd} B \ar{r}{\iota} \ar{d}{\lambda_h} & A \ar{d}{\lambda_{\iota(h)}}\\ B_h \ar{r}{\overline{\iota}} & A_h \end{tikzcd}\] Then the natural homomorphism \[\Ker(K(B) \to K(B_h)) \to \Ker(K(A) \to K(A_h))\] induced by $\iota$ is surjective.
  \item \label{PGP} {\it $K$ satisfies $\mathbb{P}^1$-glueing property for local domains.} By definition, this means that for every local domain $R \in \catname{Alg}_k$ the following diagram whose arrows are induced by natural embeddings is a pullback square: \begin{equation}\label{eq:P1-square} \begin{tikzcd} K(R) \ar[r] \ar[d] & K(R[t]) \arrow{d} \\ K(R[t^{-1}]) \ar{r} & K(R[t, t^{-1}]). \end{tikzcd} \end{equation}  
  It is easy to see that if~\eqref{eq:P1-square} is pullback, then all its arrows are injective.
  \item \label{HIF} {\it $K$ is homotopy invariant for fields}, i.\,e. $NK$ vanishes on every field $F \in \catname{Alg}_k$.
 \end{enumerate}
 Then $NK$ vanishes on every geometrically regular $R\in \catname{Alg}_k$. In other words, for every such $R$ the natural embedding $R \hookrightarrow R[t]$ induces an isomorphism $K(R)\cong K(R[t]).$
\end{theorem}
\begin{rem}
 In the literature a functor satisfying the axiom~\ref{PGP} is sometimes called {\it acyclic} (cf.~\cite[Def.~III.4.1.1]{Kbook}).
The choice of the name for~\eqref{LPP} is inspired by axiom (P3) from~\cite[Proposition~3.3.4]{AHW18}. It is easy to see that the application of $\mathrm{Spec}$ to the commutative square from~\ref{LPP} yields a distinguished Nisnevich square in the sense of~\cite[Definition~3.1.3]{MV99}. Notice also that our axioms can be slightly relaxed, so that the assertion of the Theorem becomes slightly stronger, see Remark~\ref{rem:relax} below.
\end{rem}

The proof is based on a series of lemmas and is deferred until the end of this section. We start by deducing the following useful corollary of the axiom~\ref{DP}. 

Let $k$ be an arbitrary commutative ring and $K\colon \catname{Alg}_k \to \catname{Grp}$ be a functor.
We say that $K$ satisfies the {\it Quillen--Suslin local-global principle} if for every $R\in \catname{Alg}_k$ the following map is injective:
\begin{equation} \label{QS-def} \begin{tikzcd} NK(R) \ar{r}{\prod \lambda_M} & \prod\limits_{M \in \Max(R)} NK(R_M). \end{tikzcd} \end{equation}
\begin{lemma}\label{LGP}
Suppose that $K$ is a finitary functor satisfying~\ref{DP}. Then $K$ satisfies the Quillen--Suslin local-global principle. In particular, $NK$ is a separated presheaf in the Zariski topology.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
 Fix a $k$-algebra $R$ and $a \in R$. 
 Consider the following diagram of $k$-algebras. Its objects $A_i$ are copies of $R[t]$ indexed by natural numbers $i$. The only arrows of this diagram are the homomorphisms $ev (a^{j-i}t)\colon A_i \to A_j$ defined for $1 \leq i \leq j$. It is clear that this diagram is filtered and its colimit is $R \ltimes tR_a[t]$ (cf. e.\,g.~\cite[Lemma~15]{S15}). 
 
 The first step of the proof of the lemma is to show that for every $g \in \Ker(NK(R) \to NK(R_a))$ there exists some natural $n$ such that $g(a^nt)$ is the trivial element of $K(R[t])$. Let $g$ be such an element. From~\ref{DP} we obtain that the image of $g$ in $K(R \ltimes tR_a[t])$ is trivial. The required assertion now follows from~\ref{CFC} and the previous paragraph.
 
 The next step of the proof is to verify that for any coprime elements $a, b \in R$ the homomorphism $\langle K(\lambda_a), K(\lambda_b) \rangle \colon NK(R) \to NK(R_a) \times NK(R_b)$ is injective. Fix $g \in \Ker(\langle \lambda_a, \lambda_b \rangle)$. We argue as in the proof of~\cite[Lemma~2.5]{Tu83}. Set $S := R[t, t_1]$. Consider the element $h(t, t_1, t_2) = g(t_1 t) \cdot g((t_1 + t_2)t)^{-1}\in K(S[t_2]).$ Clearly, $h$ lies in the kernel of the homomorphism $K(ev_{t_2}(0))$. Since evaluation commutes with localization, we obtain that the element $K(\lambda_a)(h) \in K(S_a[t_2])$ is trivial, therefore by the previous paragraph there exists $n$ such that $h(t, t_1, a^nt_2)$ is trivial in $K(S[t_2])$. Similarly, we find $m$ such that $h(t, t_1, b^m t_2)$ is trivial. Since $a^n$ and $b^m$ are still coprime, we can find $x, y \in R$ such that $xa^n + yb^m = 1$. The required assertion now follows from the following calculation:
 $$1 = h(t, 1, -yb^m) \cdot h(t, xa^n, -xa^n) = g(t)\cdot g(xa^n\cdot t)^{-1} \cdot g(xa^n\cdot t) \cdot g(0)^{-1} = g(t).$$
 
 Now we can finish the proof of the lemma. We argue as in the proof of~\cite[Theorem~2]{S15}. Let $g$ be an element of the kernel of~\eqref{QS-def}. Denote by $Q(g)$ the set consisting of all elements $c \in R$ for which $K(\lambda_c)(g)$ is trivial. Let us check that this set is, in fact, an ideal. Fix $a, b \in Q(g)$ and let $c$ be an element of the ideal $\langle a, b \rangle$. Notice that $\overline{a} = \lambda_c(a)$, $\overline{b} = \lambda_c(b)$ are coprime elements of $R_c$. From the identities $\lambda_{\overline{a}}\lambda_c = \lambda_{\lambda_a(c)}\lambda_a$ and $\lambda_{\overline{b}}\lambda_c = \lambda_{\lambda_b(c)}\lambda_b$ we obtain that $g' = K(\lambda_c)(g)$ lies in the kernel of $\langle K(\lambda_{\overline{a}}), K(\lambda_{\overline{b}}) \rangle.$ By the previous paragraph, we obtain that $g' = 1$ and hence that $c \in Q(g)$. We have shown that $Q(g)$ is an ideal of $R$. If $Q(g)$ is proper then it is contained in a maximal ideal $M \trianglelefteq R$, in which case from $K(\lambda_M)(g) = 1$ and~\ref{CFC} we obtain that $K(\lambda_s)(g) = 1$ for some $s \in R \setminus M$. Thus, we obtain a contradiction, so $Q(g) = R$ and $g = 1$.
\end{proof}

First of all, notice that the local-global principle allows one to obtain the following global version of~\ref{PGP} (cf. e.\,g. with the proof of~\cite[Theorem~1]{LS20}). 
\begin{lemma}[$\mathbb{P}^1$-glueing property for domains] \label{ght}
Suppose that $K$ satisfies the Quillen--Suslin local-global principle and the $\mathbb{P}^1$-glueing property for local domains. Then for an arbitrary domain $R \in \catname{Alg}_k$ the square~\eqref{eq:P1-square} is a pullback square. In particular, all its arrows are injective. \end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $R \in \catname{Alg}_k$ be an arbitrary domain. Suppose that the images of $g \in K(R[t])$ and $h \in K(R[t^{-1}])$ coincide in $K(R[t, t^{-1}])$. Then so do the images of $g' = g \cdot g(0)^{-1}$ and $h' = h \cdot g(0)^{-1}$. For a maximal ideal $M\trianglelefteq R$ set $g'_M := K(\lambda_M)(g') \in K(R_M[t])$ and $h'_M := K(\lambda_M)(h') \in K(R_M[t^{-1}]))$. Clearly, their images in $K(R_M[t, t^{-1}])$ coincide. By our assumptions, the square~\eqref{eq:P1-square} is pullback for $R_M$, therefore $g'_M = 1$ for all $M$. Since $g' \in NK(R)$, by the local-global principle we obtain that $g' = 1$, hence $g$ is the image of some element of $K(R)$. By symmetry, $h$ also is the image of some element of $K(R)$. Since $K(R)\to K(R[t, t^{-1}])$ is injective, we conclude that $g$ and $h$ are the images of the same element of $K(R)$, which completes the proof.  \end{proof}

Let us also note the following useful particular special case of weak affine Nisnevich excision.
\begin{lemma}[weak affine Zariski excision for domains]
	\label{zgl} Suppose that a functor $K\colon \catname{Alg}_k \to \catname{Grp}$ satisfies~\ref{LPP}. Let $R \in \catname{Alg}_k$ be a domain and $a, b$ be a pair of coprime elements of $R$. Consider the diagram
$$\begin{tikzcd}
	R \ar{r}{\lambda_a} \ar{d}[swap]{\lambda_b} & R_a \ar{d}{\overline{\lambda_b}}\\
	R_b \ar{r}{\overline{\lambda_a}} & R_{ab}.
\end{tikzcd}$$
	Then the natural map $\Ker(K(\lambda_b)) \to \Ker(K(\overline{\lambda_b}))$ induced by $\lambda_a$ is surjective.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Set $B=R$, $A=R_a$ and $h=b$. It is clear that $B \to A$ is an {\'e}tale homomorphism. To see that the present situation is a special case of~\ref{LPP} it is enough to  check that the map $j\colon B/hB \to A/hA$ is an isomorphism. Let us first verify the surjectivity of $j$, or what is the same, the inclusion $A \subseteq Ah+B$. Fix an element $r/a^s\in A=R_a$, we need to show that it lies in $Ah+B$. We may assume that $s\geq 1$, so that $a^s$ and $b^s$ are still coprime. Choose $x, y \in R$ such that $xa^s+yb^s=1$. Thus, $r/a^s$ can be decomposed into the sum of $rx\in B$ and $ry(b/a)^s\in bR_a=hA$.

	Now let us verify the injectivity of $j$, i.\,e. the inclusion $Ah\cap B \subseteq Bh$. Suppose that $rb/a^s=c\in B=R$. We may assume $s\geq 1$ otherwise there is nothing to prove. From $rb=a^sc$ and $xa^s+yb^s=1$ we obtain the required inclusion $c=cxa^s+cyb^s=xrb+cyb^s=(xr+cyb^{s-1})b \in Rb = Bh$. 
\end{proof}

The following injectivity result is inspired by~\cite[Corollary~5.2]{Tu83}.
\begin{lemma} \label{lmp}
Suppose that $K$ satisfies weak affine Zariski excision and $\mathbb{P}^1$-glueing properties for domains. Then for any domain $R\in \catname{Alg}_k$ and any monic polynomial $f\in R[t]$ the localization homomorphism $\lambda_f\colon R[t]\rightarrow R[t]_f$ induces an injection $K(R[t])\hookrightarrow K(R[t]_f).$ \end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Fix a presentation $f=\sum_{i=0}^n a_it^i$, in which $a_n=1$. Set $$g=1+a_{n-1}t^{-1}+\ldots+a_0t^{-n}\in R[t^{-1}].$$ It is clear that $R[t, t^{-1}]_f \cong R[t, t^{-1}]_g$. Consider the following commutative diagram:
$$\begin{tikzcd}
	R[t] \ar{r}{\lambda_t} \ar{d}{\lambda_f} & R[t, t^{-1}] \ar{d}{\overline{\lambda}} & R[t^{-1}] \ar{l}[']{\lambda_{t^{-1}}} \ar{d}{\lambda_g}\\
	R[t]_f \ar{r} & R[t, t^{-1}]_f & R[t^{-1}]_g. \ar{l}
\end{tikzcd}$$
Let $x$ be an element of $\Ker(K(\lambda_f))$. Then $K(\lambda_t)(x)$ lies in $\Ker(K(\overline{\lambda}))$ so by~\cref{zgl} applied to the right square we find $y \in \Ker(K(\lambda_{g}))$ such that $K(\lambda_t)(x) = K(\lambda_{t^{-1}})(y)$. Now by~\cref{ght} $x$ and $y$ are images of some $z \in K(R)$. 
Since the composite homomorphism $K(R) \to K(R[t^{-1}]_g) \xrightarrow{K(ev_{t^{-1}}(0))} K(R)$ coincides with the identity map, we conclude that $z=1$, consequently $x = y = 1$ and the proof is complete. \end{proof}

For the rest of this section we assume that $k$ is a field.
Recall that a $k$-algebra $R$ is called {\it essentially smooth} if it is geometrically regular and essentially of finite type over $k$. 
Equivalently, $R$ is essentially smooth over $k$ if it is essentially of finite type over $k$ and $R\otimes_k\overline k$ is regular (see e.\,g.~\cite[p.~137]{Sw98}). 
If, moreover, $R$ is of finite type over $k$, it is called {\it smooth over $k$}.

\begin{theorem}[Panin]\label{thm:Panin}
\label{paninthm}
	Let $k$ be a field, $R$ be a domain smooth over $k$. Let $M_1,\ldots, M_n$ be a finite set of maximal ideals of $R$. Denote by $A=R_{M_1,\ldots,M_n}$ the corresponding semi-localization of $R$. Let $f$ be an element of the intersection  $\cap_{i=1}^nM_i \subseteq R$. Then there exist a monic polynomial $h(t)\in A[t]$, a domain $S$ essentially smooth over $k$ and homomorphisms $\tau$, $p$, $p'$ and $\delta$ such that $\tau^*\colon\mathrm{Spec}(S)\to\mathrm{Spec}(A[t])$ is an {\'e}tale morphism and the following diagram commutes:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:panin-diag}
 \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=4em]
   & A & \\ A[t] \ar{d}{\lambda_h} \ar{ru}{ev(0)} \ar{r}{\tau} & S \ar{u}{\delta} \ar{d}{\lambda_{\tau(h)}}  & R \ar{ul}[swap]{\lambda_{M_1,\ldots,M_n}} \ar{d}{\lambda_f} \ar{l}[swap]{p} \\
   A[t]_h \ar{r}[swap]{\tau\otimes_{A[t]}A[t]_h}              & S_{\tau(h)}      & R_f. \ar{l}{p'}\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
Additionally, the homomorphism $\tau$ is an injection and one has $A[t]/hA[t]\cong S/\tau(h)S.$ 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
 All of the assertions except the last two are a direct ring-theoretic restatement of (i)--(iii) of~\cite[Theorem~2.5]{Pa19}.
	Since $\tau^*$ is open and $S\neq 0$, $\tau(S)$ is dominant. Denote by $I$ the kernel of $\tau$. The closed subscheme defined by $I$ must contain the image of $\tau^*$ therefore $I$ is radical. Since $A[t]$ is a domain we conclude that $I=0$.		

	Set $X = \mathrm{Spec}(A[t]/h)$, $Y = \mathrm{Spec}(S/h)$. We need to show that the morphism $\tau' \colon Y \to X$ obtained from $\tau^*$ by restriction is an isomorphism. Set $Y_0 := Y \times_{X} X_\mathrm{red}$. From the fact that the left square is an elementary distinguished Nisnevich square we obtain that the composite morphism $Y_\mathrm{red} \not\hookrightarrow Y_0 \xrightarrow{\tau''} X_\mathrm{red}$ is an isomorphism, consequently since $\tau''$ is {\'e}tale, the closed embedding $(Y_0)_\mathrm{red} = Y_\mathrm{red} \not\hookrightarrow Y_0$ is also {\'e}tale, hence an open embedding, hence an isomorphism (see e.\,g. Corollary~3.6, Proposition~3.10 of~\cite{Mi80}). Thus, we conclude that $\tau''$ is an isomorphism and hence by the topological invariance of {\'e}tale morphisms~\cite[Theorem~3.23]{Mi80}, so is $\tau'$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
\label{esssmooth}
Let $k$ be a field.
Suppose that $K\colon\catname{Alg}_k\rightarrow\catname{Grp}$ is finitary and satisfies weak affine Nisnevich excision and $\mathbb{P}^1$-glueing properties. Let $R, M_1, \ldots, M_n, A$ be as in the statement of the above theorem. Denote by $E$ the fraction field of $A$ {\rm(}which coincides with the fraction field of $R${\rm)}.
Then for any $m\geq 0$ the natural homomorphism $K(A[x_1,\ldots, x_m])\to K(E[x_1,\ldots,x_m])$ is injective.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
We argue as in the proof of~\cite[Theorem~3.2]{Sta20}. Set $B=k[x_1,\ldots x_m]$. Let $g$ be an element of the kernel of $K(B \otimes_k A)\rightarrow K(B \otimes_k E)$. First of all, notice that both $A$ and $E$ are filtered colimits of principal localizations of $R$. Since $K$ is finitary, there exists $f' \in \cap_{i=1}^n(R \setminus M_i)$ such that $g$ is the image of some $g_1 \in K(R_{f'}[x_1,\ldots x_m])$ under $K(\lambda_{M_1',\ldots M_n'})$, where $M_i' = R_{f'} \cdot M_i$. Set $R' := R_{f'}$.
Clearly, there exists $f \in R'$ such that $K(\lambda_{f})(g_1) = 1$ in $K(R'_{f})$. 
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $f \in \cap_{i=1}^n M_i'$. 

We apply Theorem~\ref{paninthm} to the ring $R'$, maximal ideals $M_i'$ and the polynomial $f$ as above.
Tensoring~\eqref{eq:panin-diag} with $B$ and applying functor $K$ we obtain the following commutative diagram (we use the convention that tensoring with $B$ does not change the notation for the arrows of the diagram):
\begin{equation*} 
 \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=4em]
   & K(B \otimes_k A) & \\ 
   K(B \otimes_k A[t]) \ar{d}{K(\lambda_h)} \ar{ru}{K(ev_t(0))} \ar{r}{K(\tau)} & K(B \otimes_k S) \ar{u}{K(\delta)} \ar{d}{K(\lambda_{\tau(h)})}  & K(B \otimes_k R') \ar{ul}[swap]{K(\lambda)} \ar{d}{K(\lambda_f)} \ar{l}[swap]{K(p)} \\
   K(B \otimes_k A[t]_h) \ar{r}[swap]{}              & K(B \otimes_k S_{\tau(h)})      & K(B \otimes_k R'_f). \ar{l}{}\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
Notice that $K(p)(g_1)$ lies in the kernel of $K(\lambda_{\tau(h)})$, therefore by~\ref{LPP} there exists $g_2\in K(B \otimes_k A[t])$ such that $K(\lambda_h)(g_2)=1$ and $K(\tau)(g_2)=K(p)(g_1)$. Since $h \in A[t]$ is monic, by~\cref{lmp} the homomorphism $K(\lambda_h)$ is injective, therefore $g_2=1$. It remains to see that
$$g=K(\lambda)(g_1)=K(\delta)(K(p)(g_1))=K(\delta)(K(\tau)(g_2))=g_2(0)=1.\qedhere$$
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
For the proof of~\cref{lpb} we only need the special cases $m=0,1$ of the above result.
\end{rem}

\begin{theorem}[Popescu]
\label{popescu} Let $k$ be a field, and $R$ a ring geometrically regular over $k$. Then $R$ is a filtered colimit of smooth $k$-algebras. \end{theorem}
\begin{proof} See~\cite{Po85}, ~\cite[Theorem~1.1]{Sw98}.
\end{proof}

Now we are ready to finish the proof of \cref{lpb}. %Our argument follows~\cite{Sta14, Vo81}.
\begin{proof}[Proof of~\cref{lpb}]
Our goal is to prove the triviality of $NK(R)$.
By~\cref{popescu} $R$ is a filtered colimit of smooth $k$-algebras.
Since filtered colimits commute with finite limits and the functor $K$ is finitary, the functor $NK$ is also finitary.
Thus, it suffices to verify the triviality of $NK(R)$ for a smooth $k$-algebra $R$.
Further, by~\cref{LGP} we are left to prove that $NK(R_M)$ is trivial for every maximal ideal $M$ in a such an algebra.
Since every smooth scheme over $k$ is a disjoint union of smooth irreducible $k$-schemes, we may assume, without loss of generality, that $R$ is a domain.
Denote by $E$ the fraction field of $R_M$. Consider the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
K\bigl(R_M[t]\bigr) \ar[hookrightarrow]{r} \ar{d}{ev_t(0)} & K(E[t]) \ar{d}{\cong}\\
K\bigl(R_M\bigr) \ar[hookrightarrow]{r} & K(E),
\end{tikzcd}\]
in which the right vertical arrow is an isomorphism by~\ref{HIF} and the horizontal arrows are injective by Corollary~\ref{esssmooth}.

Thus, the left vertical arrow is also injective and $NK(R_M) = 1$, as required.
\end{proof}
\begin{rem}\label{rem:relax}
It is clear from the above proof that it possible to weaken the requirements on $K$ in the statement of~\cref{lpb}. For example, we could require that axioms \ref{DP}--\ref{PGP} hold true only for the algebras essentially smooth over $k$. Further, the assertion of the axiom~\ref{CFC} can be restricted to algebras geometrically regular over $k$.
\end{rem}

We can also prove the following result (cf.~\cite[Th{\'e}or{\`e}me~1.1]{CTO92}, cf. also with~\cite[Proposition~2.2]{AHW20}).
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:gb}
Let $k$ be a field.
Suppose that $K\colon\catname{Alg}_k\rightarrow\catname{Grp}$
is a finitary functor satisfying weak affine Nisnevich excision and $\mathbb{P}^1$-glueing properties for domains. 
Let $A$ be a semi-local domain geometrically regular over $k$. 
Denote by $E$ the fraction field of $A$.
Then the natural homomorphism $K(A) \to K(E)$ is injective.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{popescu} $A$ is a filtered colimit of smooth $k$-algebras. Since $A$ is a domain we may assume additionally that these smooth $k$-algebras are domains.

Since $K$ is finitary, we may assume that $g \in \Ker(K(A) \to K(E))$ comes from some element $g_1\in\mathrm K(R)$, where $R$ is a smooth $k$-domain. We may assume, additionally, that $g_1$ lies in the kernel of the natural homomorphism $K(R) \to K(\mathrm{Frac}(R))$.

Denote by $P_i$ the preimages of the maximal ideals of $A$ and choose some maximal ideals $M_i$ of $R$ such that $M_i$ contains $P_i$. Then by \cref{esssmooth}, $g_1$ vanishes in the semi-localization of $R$ in the set of maximal ideals $M_i$, therefore it vanishes in the semi-localization of $R$ in the set of prime ideals $P_i$. Since $R\rightarrow A$ factors through the latter semi-localization, we conclude that $g=1$. 
\end{proof}

\section{Proof of the main results} \label{sec:main-results}
\subsection{Proof of Theorems~\ref{theorem:LP-for-K2} and~\ref{theorem:Gersten}}
Recall that for a simply-laced root system $\Phi$ of rank $\geq 2$ and a commutative ring $R$ the Steinberg group $\St(\Phi, R)$ is defined by means of the generators $x_\alpha(\xi)$, $\xi \in R$ and the following set of defining relations:
\begin{align}
x_{\alpha}(a)\cdot x_{\alpha}(b)&=x_{\alpha}(a+b),\text{ for } \alpha\in \Phi;\tag{R1} \label{R1}\\
[x_{\alpha}(a),\,x_{\beta}(b)]  &=1,\text{ for }\alpha+\beta\not\in\Phi\cup 0; \tag{R2} \label{R2} \\
[x_{\alpha}(a),\,x_{\beta}(b)]  &=x_{\alpha+\beta}(N_{\alpha\beta} \cdot ab)\text{ in the case }\alpha+\beta\in\Phi. \tag{R3} \label{R3} \end{align}
The integers $N_{\alpha,\beta} = \pm 1$ appearing in the last identity are called the {\it structure constants} of the Chevalley group $\mathrm{G}_\mathrm{sc}(\Phi, R)$. They coincide with the structure constants of the corresponding simple Lie algebra. More information about them and further references can be found e.\,g. in~\cite[\S~2.4]{LSV20}).

We denote by $\E(\Phi, R)$ the {\it elementary subgroup} of $\Gsc(\Phi, R)$. It is defined as the abstract subgroup generated by elementary root unipotents $t_\alpha(\xi)$, $\alpha \in \Phi$, $\xi \in R$, see e.\,g.~\cite{St71, St78, VZ20, Abe83,}. It is clear that $\E(\Phi, R)$ is the image of the homomorphism $\pi$ from~\eqref{eq:main-exactSeq}.

For $a, b \in R$ set $y_\alpha(a, b) = [x_\alpha(a), x_{-\alpha}(b)]$.
For an ideal $I \trianglelefteq R$ we denote by $\overline{\St}(\Phi, R, I)$ the normal closure in $\St(\Phi, R)$ of the subgroup generated by $x_\alpha(a)$, $a\in I$. Recall from~\cite[Lemma~5]{S15} that it coincides with the kernel of the natural morphism of Steinberg groups $\St(\Phi, R) \to \St(\Phi, R/I)$.

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:c-identities} For an arbitrary irreducible root system $\Phi$ of rank $\geq 2$, arbitrary ideals $A, B \trianglelefteq R$ and all $a \in A$, $b \in B$, $c \in R$ the following congruences hold:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $y_\alpha(a, cb) \equiv y_\alpha(ac, b)\ (\mathrm{mod}\ \overline{\St}(\Phi, R, AB))$ in the case when either $\Phi \neq \rC_{\ell}$ or $\alpha$ is short.
 \item $y_\alpha(a, c^2b) \equiv y_\alpha(ac^2, b)\ (\mathrm{mod}\ \overline{\St}(\Phi, R, AB))$, $y_\alpha(a, cb)^2 \equiv y_\alpha(ac, b)^2\ (\mathrm{mod}\ \overline{\St}(\Phi, R, AB))$ in the case $\Phi = \rC_{\ell}$ and $\alpha$ is long.
\end{itemize} \end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
 Observe that the proof of~\cite[Theorem~5]{VZ20} is based solely on computations with Chevalley commutator formula, which all can be reproduced verbatim for Steinberg groups.
\end{proof}

Notice that the Steinberg group functor {\it does not} commute with general finite limits. However, it satisfies the following weaker property, which we are going to use in the sequel.
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:fprod} For an arbitrary irreducible root system $\Phi$ of rank $\geq 2$ the Steinberg group functor $\St(\Phi, -)$ commutes with finite direct products. \end{lemma}
\begin{proof} 
It suffices to verify the assertion for binary direct products.
Observe that canonical projections $R_1 \times R_2 \to R_i$, $i=1,2$ split in the category of rings without unit, therefore the groups $G_i = \St(\Phi, R_i)$ embed as subgroups into $G = \St(\Phi, R_1 \times R_2)$. It is also clear that $G_i$ together generate $G$. Thus, to verify the isomorphism $G \cong G_1 \times G_2$ it suffices to show the triviality of the commutator subgroup $[G_1, G_2] \leq G$.

Set $A = R_1\times 0$, $B = 0 \times R_2$. It is clear that $A, B \trianglelefteq R_1 \times R_2$. 
It follows directly from~\eqref{R2}--\eqref{R3} that the commutators $[x_{\alpha}(a),\ x_\beta(b)]$ are trivial for all $\beta \neq -\alpha$, $a \in A$, $b\in B$. On the other hand, to verify the triviality of $y_\alpha(a, b)$ we can apply the congruences of~\cref{lem:c-identities} (since $AB=0$ these congruences turn into equalities).
Indeed, setting $c = c^2 = (1, 0)$ we obtain that $y_\alpha(a, b) = y_\alpha(ac, b) = y_\alpha(a, bc) = y_\alpha(a, 0) = 1$. \end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{k2cdc} 
For an arbitrary root system $\Phi$ the functors $\Gsc(\Phi,\,-)$, $\St(\Phi,\,-)$ and $\K_2(\Phi,\,-)$ commute with filtered colimits.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The assertion for $\mathrm G_{\mathrm{sc}}(\Phi,\,-)$ follows from the fact that it is represented in the category $\catname{Ring}$ by a finitely presented Hopf $\ZZ$-algebra (see e.\,g. \cite[Lemma~10.127.3]{stacks-project}). The assertion for $\St(\Phi, -)$ is obvious from its definition. The assertion for the functor $\K_2(\Phi, -)$ now follows from the assertions for $\St(\Phi, -)$ and $\Gsc(\Phi, R)$ using the fact that filtered colimits commute with finite limits in $\catname{Grp}$ (in particular, they commute with kernels).
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorems~\ref{theorem:LP-for-K2} and~\ref{theorem:Gersten}]
We need to check that the axioms \ref{CFC}--\ref{HIF} are satisfied. Axiom~\ref{CFC} is satisfied by~\cref{k2cdc}. Axiom~\ref{DP} follows from the fact that for a simply-laced $\Phi$ of rank $\geq 3$ Steinberg groups $\St(\Phi, -)$ satisfy Tulenbaev lifting property in the sense of~\cite[Definition~2.1]{LS17} (more precisely, \ref{DP} follows from the injectivity of the left arrow in the diagram~(2.2) ibid.).
The axiom~\ref{LPP} is checked in~\cref{sec:patching} below.
In the case $\Phi = \rA_\ell$ the axiom~\ref{PGP} is satisfied by~\cite[Theorem~5.1]{Tu83}. In the orthogonal case it is satisfied by~\cite[Theorem~1]{LS20}. Finally, axiom~\ref{HIF} is satisfied by the Korollar of \cite[Satz~1]{Re75}.

Notice that every regular ring containing a field $k$ is geometrically regular over a perfect subfield of $k$. Now the assertion of~\cref{theorem:LP-for-K2} follows from~\cref{lpb}, while the assertion of~\cref{theorem:Gersten} follows from~\cref{thm:gb}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\K_2(\Phi, R)$}{K2(R)} as $\mathbb{A}^1$-fundamental group}
Recall from~\cite{Jar83} that for an arbitrary commutative (unital) ring $R$ one can define the standard simplicial ring $R[\Delta^\bullet]$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
 R[\Delta^n] = R[t_0,\ldots t_n]/\langle \sum_{i=0}^n t_i -1 \rangle,\ d_i(t_j) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}t_j & j < i, \\0 & j = i, \\ t_{j-1} & j > i; \end{array}\right. s_i(t_j) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} t_j & j < i, \\ t_j + t_{j+1} & j = i, \\ t_{j+1} & j > i. \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
	The application of a functor $G\colon\catname{Ring}\rightarrow\catname{Grp}$ to $R[\Delta^\bullet]$ yields a simplicial group $G(R[\Delta^\bullet])$, which in the context of $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory is usually called the {\it simplicial resolution} of $G$ and is denoted by $\mathrm{Sing}^{\mathbb{A}^1}_\bullet(G)(R)$. Recall also, that the $n$-th {\it unstable Karoubi--Villamayor K-functor attached to $G$} (denoted $\mathrm{KV}^G_n(R)$) is, by definition, the $n-1$-th simplicial homotopy group of $\Gsc(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet])$ (cf.~\cite[\S~4.3]{AHW18}, \cite[\S~3]{Jar83}).

Recall from~\cite[\S~17]{May67} that the homotopy group $\pi_n(G)$ of a simplicial group $(G_\bullet, d_i, s_i)$ can be computed as $n$-th homology group of the normalized Moore complex
\[ 1 \leftarrow N_0(G) \xleftarrow{\partial_1} N_1(G) \xleftarrow{\partial_2} N_2(G) \xleftarrow{\partial_3} \ldots\,, \]
in which $N_n(G) = \cap_{i=1}^n\Ker(d_i) \trianglelefteq G_n$ and the differential $\partial_k$ is obtained from $d_0\colon G_k \to G_{k-1}$ by restriction. In other words, $\pi_n(G) \cong \mathrm{H}_n(N_\bullet G) = \Ker(\partial_n) / \Im(\partial_{n+1})$.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:pi1-StDelta} Let $\Phi$ be an arbitrary irreducible root system. Then for any commutative ring $R$ the simplicial groups $\E(\Phi,\,R[\Delta^\bullet])$ and $\St(\Phi,\,R[\Delta^\bullet])$ are connected. If, moreover, $\Phi$ has rank at least $2$ then the simplicial group $\St(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet])$ is simply-connected. \end{prop}
\begin{proof}
In our computations we identify the ring $R[\Delta^n]$ with $R[t_1, \ldots, t_n]$ via $t_0 = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^n t_i$. 

The map $d_1\colon\St(\Phi,\,R[\Delta^1])\rightarrow\St(\Phi,\,R[\Delta^0])$ is given by $t_1\mapsto0$, therefore \[N_1\St(\Phi,\,R[\Delta^\bullet])=\Ker(d_1)=\St(\Phi,\,R[t_1],\,\langle t_1\rangle),\]
and $\partial_1\colon N_1\St(\Phi,\,R[\Delta^\bullet])\rightarrow N_0\St(\Phi,\,R[\Delta^\bullet])=\St(\Phi,\,R)$ is induced by $d_0$, which sends $t_1$ to $t_0=1$. 
It is clear that $x_\alpha(r)$ of $\St(\Phi, R)$ is the image of $x_\alpha(rt_1)$ under $\partial_1$.
This shows that $\St(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet])$ is connected. The argument for $\mathrm{E}(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet])$ is identical.

Now let us verify the second assertion. Notice that the kernel of $\partial_1$ coincides with the intersection $\overline{\St}(\Phi,\,R[t_1],\,\langle t_1\rangle)\cap\overline{\St}(\Phi,\,R[t_1],\,\langle t_1-1 \rangle )$, or, what is the same, with the kernel of the homomorphism
\[\St(\Phi,\,R[t_1])\rightarrow\St(\Phi,\,R)\times\St(\Phi,\,R)\]
sending $g(t_1)$ to $\big(g(0),\,g(1)\big)$. By~\cref{lem:fprod} this homomorphism can be identified with the homomorphism $\St(\Phi, R[t_1]) \to \St(\Phi, R\times R)$ induced by the ring homomorphism of evaluation of $t_1$ at $(0, 1)$.

Since the ideals $\langle t_1 \rangle$ and $\langle t_1-1 \rangle$ are coprime, we can identify $R\times R$ with $R[t_1]/t_1(t_1-1)$ by the Chinese remainder theorem. Thus, we obtain that $\Ker(\partial_1)$ coincides with $\overline{\St}(\Phi,\,R[t_1],\,\langle t_1(t_1-1) \rangle)$ and, in particular, is generated by $x_\alpha\big(t_1(t_1-1)f(t_1)\big)^{g(t_1)}$, where $\alpha \in \Phi$, $f\in R[t_1]$, $g \in \St(\Phi, R[t_1])$.

Notice that the face maps $d_1, d_2\colon\mathrm{St}(\Phi,\,R[\Delta^2])\rightarrow\mathrm{St}(\Phi,\,R[\Delta^1])$ are given by evaluations ($t_1\mapsto0$, $t_2\mapsto t_1$) and ($t_1\mapsto t_1$, $t_2\mapsto0$), respectively. Thus, we obtain that \[N_2\mathrm{St}(\Phi,\,R[\Delta^\bullet])=\Ker(d_1)\cap\Ker(d_2)=\overline{\St}(\Phi,\,R[t_1,\,t_2],\,\langle t_1\rangle )\cap\overline{\St}(\Phi,\,R[t_1,\,t_2],\,\langle t_2\rangle).\]
The differential $\partial_2$ is induced by the face map $d_0 \colon \St(\Phi, R[\Delta^2]) \to \St(\Phi, R[\Delta^1])$, which, in turn, is given by the evaluation ($t_1 \mapsto 1-t_1$, $t_2 \mapsto t_1$). 

It remains to see that the elements $x_{\alpha}\big(t_1t_2\,f(t_2)\big)^{g(t_2)}$ belong to $N_2\St(\Phi,\,R[\Delta^\bullet])$ and are mapped by $\partial_2$ onto the generating set of $\Ker(\partial_1)$ mentioned above. Thus, the normalized Moore complex for $\St(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet])$ is exact at $N_1$-term, which completes the proof of the proposition. \end{proof}

Let $f\colon G_\bullet\twoheadrightarrow Q_\bullet$ be a degreewise surjective morphism of simplicial groups (i.\,e. $f_n\colon G_n\to Q_n$ are surjective for all $n$). Recall from~\cite[Theorem~1.3]{Ina75} that in this situation the degreewise kernel $K_\bullet$ (i.\,e. the simplicial group given by $K_n = \Ker(f_n)$ with face and degeneracy maps induced from those of $G_\bullet$) yields a long exact sequence of groups
\begin{equation} \label{eq:simplicial-les} \begin{tikzcd} \ldots \ar{r} & \pi_{1}(G_\bullet) \ar{r} & \pi_1(Q_\bullet) \ar{r} & \pi_0(K_\bullet) \ar{r} & \pi_0(G_\bullet). \end{tikzcd} \end{equation}

\begin{theorem} \label{theorem:pi1-GRDelta}
 For $\Phi$ and $R$ as in~\cref{theorem:LP-for-K2} one has $\pi_1(\Gsc(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet])) = \K_2(\Phi, R)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
First of all, notice that by the homotopy invariance for $\K_1$ (see e.\,g.~\cite[Theorem~1.1]{Sta20}) the simplicial group $\K_1(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet])$ is discrete. Applying the exact sequence~\eqref{eq:simplicial-les} to the canonical morphism $\Gsc(\Phi\,,R[\Delta^\bullet]) \to \K_1(\Phi\,,R[\Delta^\bullet])$, we obtain that $\pi_1(\Gsc(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet])) \cong \pi_1(\E(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet]))$.
 
Now consider the simplicial map $\mathrm{st}_\bullet \colon \St(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet]) \to \E(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet])$ given by canonical projections $\mathrm{st}$ in each degree. The application of~\eqref{eq:simplicial-les} yields an exact sequence of groups
\[
\pi_1\bigl(\St(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet])\bigr) \to \pi_1\bigl(\E(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet])\bigr) \to \pi_0\bigl(\K_2(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet])\bigr) \to \pi_0\bigl(\St(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet])\bigr).
\]
 Proposition~\ref{prop:pi1-StDelta} implies that the first and the last groups in this exact sequence are trivial, so the two central groups are isomorphic. On the other hand, \cref{theorem:LP-for-K2} implies that $\K_2(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet])$ is discrete, so $\pi_0(\K_2(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet])) = \K_2(\Phi, R)$, as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of~\cref{cor:motivic-pi1}] 
 By~\cite[Corollary~5.4]{Sta20} for every regular $k$-algebra $R$ one has \[\mathrm H^1_\mathrm{Nis}(R, \Gsc(\Phi, -)) = \mathrm H^1_\mathrm{Nis}(R[t], \Gsc(\Phi, -)),\] consequently by~\cite[Theorem~2.4.2]{AHW18} the $k$-scheme $\Gsc(\Phi, -)$ defines an $\mathbb{A}^1$-naive presheaf on $\mathrm{Sm}_k^{aff}$ in the sense of~\cite[Definition~2.1.1]{AHW18}.
 In particular, one has $\pi_1^{\mathbb{A}^1}(\Gsc(\Phi, -))(R) = \pi_1(\Gsc(\Phi, R[\Delta^\bullet]))$, the latter group being isomorphic to $\K_2(\Phi, R)$ by the above theorem.
\end{proof}

\section{Nisnevich glueing for \texorpdfstring{$\K_2(\Phi, R)$}{K2(Ф,R)}} \label{sec:patching}
The main result of this section is the following glueing theorem for Steinberg groups.
\begin{theorem}\label{glueing}
Let $\iota\colon B \hookrightarrow A$ be an embedding of integral domains, $h\in B \setminus \{0\}$ be such that $B / hB = A / \iota(h)A$. Let $\Phi$ be an arbitrary simply-laced root system of rank at least $3$.
Then the group $\St(\Phi, B)$ surjects onto the pullback of the homomorphisms 
$\lambda_{\iota(h)}\colon \St(\Phi, A) \to \St(\Phi, A_{\iota(h)})$, $\overline{\iota}\colon\St(\Phi, B_h) \to \St(\Phi, A_{\iota(h)})$. In particular the functors $\St(\Phi, -)$, $\K_2(\Phi, -)$ satisfy weak affine Nisnevich excision for domains and the following sequence of pointed sets is exact in the central term
\begin{equation} \begin{tikzcd} \K_2(\Phi, B) \ar{rrr}{g \mapsto (\lambda_h(g), \iota(g))} & &  & \K_2(\Phi, B_h) \times \K_2(\Phi, A) \ar{rrrr}{(g_1,g_2) \mapsto \overline{\iota}(g_1) \lambda_{\iota(h)}(g_2)^{-1}} & & & & \K_2(\Phi, A_{\iota(h)}) \end{tikzcd} \end{equation}
\end{theorem}
The above result generalizes~\cite[Proposition~1.4]{Tu83}, which is formulated for the Zariski topology and the special case $\Phi=\rA_{\geq 4}$.
The analogues of the above theorem for the functor $\K_1$ have also been obtained by E.~Abe and A.~Stavrova, cf.~\cite[Lemma~3.7]{Abe83}, \cite[Lemma~3.4]{Sta14}.
The analogous result for projective modules is the ``descent lemma'' \cite[Lemma~4.7]{Bh99} due to W.~Lutkebohmert, H.~Lindel and M.~Kumar. 

\subsection{Overview of Steinberg pro-groups}
We refer the reader to \cite[Section~6.1]{SK06} for an introduction to the formalism of ind-objects and pro-objects. We also refer to~\cite[\S~2]{LSV20} for a more detailed exposition of the material presented in this subsection.

We start by recalling the definition of the {\it pro-completion} $\catname{Pro}(\mathcal{C})$ of a category $\mathcal{C}$ (cf.~\cite[\S~2.1]{LSV20}).
By definition, the objects of $\catname{Pro}(\mathcal{C})$ are functors $X^{(\infty)}\colon\mathcal{I}^{\mathrm{op}} \to \mathcal{C}$, where $\mathcal{I}$ is a small nonempty filtered category. For $X^{(\infty)} \in 
\catname{Pro}(\mathcal{C})$ and $i \in \mathcal{I}$ we denote by $X^{(i)}$ the value of $X^{(\infty)}$ on $i$. 
We call the images of $X^{(\infty)}$ on the arrows of $\mathcal{I}$ the {\it structure morphisms} of $X^{(\infty)}$.

Let $X^{(\infty)}\colon\mathcal{I}\to\mathcal{C}$ and $Y^{(\infty)}\colon\mathcal{J}\to\mathcal{C}$ be a pair of pro-objects.
By definition, a {\it pre-morphism} $\eta\colon X^{(\infty)} \to Y^{(\infty)}$ is a pair $(\eta^*, \{\eta_j\}_{j\in\mathrm{Ob}(\mathcal{J})})$ consisting of a map $\eta^*\colon \mathrm{Ob}(\mathcal{J})\to\mathrm{Ob}(\mathcal{I})$ and a collection of $\mathcal{C}$-morphisms $\eta_j\colon X^{(\eta^*(j))}\to Y^{(j)}$ such that for every arrow $j' \to j$ there exists $i$ such that the composite morphisms $X^{(i)} \to X^{(\eta^*(j'))} \xrightarrow{\eta_{j'}} Y^{(j')}$ and $X^{(i)} \to X^{(\eta^*(j))} \xrightarrow{\eta_j} Y^{(j)} \to Y^{(j')}$ are equal. We call the individual $\mathcal{C}$-morphism $\eta_j$ {\it the degree $j$ component} of $\eta$.
Pre-morphisms $\eta, \epsilon \colon X^{(\infty)} \to Y^{(\infty)}$ are declared equivalent if for every $j \in \mathrm{Ob}(\mathcal{J})$ there exists $i \in \mathrm{Ob}(\mathcal{I})$ such that the composite morphisms $X^{(i)} \to X^{(\eta^*(j))} \xrightarrow{\eta_j} Y^{(j)}$ and $X^{(i)} \to X^{(\epsilon^*(j))} \xrightarrow{\epsilon_j} Y^{(j)}$ are equal. By definition, the set of morphisms $\catname{Pro}(\mathcal{C})(X^{(\infty)}, Y^{(\infty)})$ consists of equivalence classes $[\eta]$ of pre-morphisms $\eta \colon X^{(\infty)} \to Y^{(\infty)}$ with respect to the equivalence relation defined above. The composition of a pair of morphisms \([\eta] \colon X^{(\infty)} \to Y^{(\infty)}\) and \([\zeta] \colon Y^{(\infty)} \to Z^{(\infty)}\) is defined as the class $[\zeta \circ \eta]$, where the pre-morphism \(\zeta \circ \eta\) is given by \((\zeta \circ \eta)^*(i) = \eta^*(\zeta^*(i))\) and \((\zeta\circ \eta)_{i} = \zeta_{i} \circ \eta_{\zeta^*(i)}\). There is a fully faithful embedding $\mathcal{C}\to\catname{Pro}(\mathcal{C})$ sending $X \in \mathrm{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ to the obvious functor $X\colon \{ * \} \to \mathcal{C}$. 

Let $R$ be an integral domain and $S$ a multiplicative subset of $R$ containing $1$. 
We denote by $\lambda_S$ the canonical localization homomorphism $R \to R_S$.
We also reuse the same notation for the induced homomorphism $\St(\Phi, R) \to \St(\Phi, R_S)$ of Steinberg groups.

Notice that $S$ can be interpreted as a filtered category with $\mathrm{Ob}(S) = S$ and $S(s, t) = \{ u \in S \mid su = t \}$.
For shortness, we call a commutative ring without unit an {\it rng} and denote the category of rngs by $\catname{Rng}$.
For $s\in S$ the principal ideal $sR$ can be considered as an rng. We define the pro-rng $R^{(\infty)}$ as the functor $S^\mathrm{op} \to \catname{Rng}$ whose value on an arrow $(s \to t)\in S$ is defined as the obvious embedding of rngs $tR \hookrightarrow sR$. Obviously, $R^{(\infty)}$ depends on $S$, however for shortness we suppress $S$ from the notation.

Recall that the {\it Steinberg pro-group} $\St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R)$ is defined as the functor $S^\mathrm{op} \to \catname{Grp}$ obtained from the pro-rng $R^{(\infty)}$ by postcomposition with $\St(\Phi, -)$ (cf.~\cite[\S~2.4]{LSV20}). We denote by $\pi_S$ the pro-group morphism $\St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R) \to \St(\Phi, R_S)$ defined by the pre-morphism $\pi^* \colon \{* \} \to S$, $\pi^*(*) = 1$, $\pi_{*} = \lambda_S \colon \St(\Phi, R) \to \St(\Phi, R_S)$. 

For $\alpha \in \Phi$ we define the pro-group morphism $x_\alpha \colon R^{(\infty)} \to \St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R)$ by means of the following data: $(x_\alpha)^* = \mathrm{id}_S$, $(x_\alpha)_s \colon sR \to \St(\Phi, sR)$, $sr \mapsto x_\alpha(sr)$. These morphisms, which we call {\it root subgroup morphisms}, allow one to characterize the Steinberg pro-group $\St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R)$ by means of a universal property (cf.~\cite[Lemma~2.16]{LSV20}). For instance, $\St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R)$ is ``generated'' by $x_\alpha$ in the sense that a pair of pro-group morphisms $f, g \colon \St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R) \to G^{(\infty)}$ coincide if and only if $f \circ x_\beta = g \circ x_\beta$ for all $\beta \in \Phi$.
It is enough to verify the latter equalities for $\beta \in \Phi\setminus\{\alpha\}$ where $\alpha \in \Phi$ is any fixed root (in fact, an even stronger result holds, see~\cite[Lemma~3.2]{LSV20}). % TODO: \cite[Lemma~11]{V20}?
Moreover, given a collection of pro-group morphisms $f_\alpha \colon R^{(\infty)} \to G^{(\infty)}$ satisfying the ``pro-analogues'' of Chevalley commutator identities (see~\cite[Remark~2.15]{LSV20}), there exists a unique morphism $f \colon \St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R) \to G^{(\infty)}$ such that $f_\alpha = f \circ x_\alpha$ for all $\alpha\in\Phi$. 
\begin{prop}\label{prop:conj-action}
 For an irreducible root system $\Phi$ of rank $\geq 3$ and a multiplicative system $S\subseteq R$ there exists a group homomorphism $conj\colon \St(\Phi, R_S) \to \mathrm{Aut}(\St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R))$ compatible with the obvious conjugation action of $\St(\Phi, R_S)$ on itself, i.\,e. such that for every $g \in \St(\Phi, R_S)$ the following diagram of pro-groups commutes:
 \begin{equation} \label{eq:conj-pis} \begin{tikzcd} \St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R) \ar{r}{conj(g)} \ar{d}{\pi_S} & \St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R) \ar{d}{\pi_S} \\ \St(\Phi, R_S) \ar{r}{{}^g\!(-)} & \St(\Phi, R_S). \end{tikzcd} \end{equation}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The existence of the homomorphism $conj$ has been demonstrated in~\cite[Proposition~4.2]{LSV20}.
 %TODO: (for $\Phi\neq\rB_\ell, \rC_\ell$) and the beginning of Section~10 of~\cite{V20} (for $\Phi=\rB_\ell, \rC_\ell$). 
Thus, we only need to verify the commutativity of the diagram~\eqref{eq:conj-pis}. 
Since $conj$ is a homomorphism, it is enough to consider the case $g = x_\alpha(u)$, $\alpha \in \Phi$, $u \in R_S$. In view of the above discussion, to verify the commutativity of~\eqref{eq:conj-pis} it is enough to verify the equalities $\pi_S \circ conj(g) \circ x_\beta= {}^g\!(-) \circ \pi_S \circ x_\beta$ for $\beta\neq -\alpha$.
 It remains to see that the fulfillment of these equalities is a direct consequence of the definition of $conj(g) \circ x_\beta$ (the formulas for these morphisms are given by formulas (4.5)--(4.6) of~\cite{LSV20}). \end{proof} %TODO: cf. also~\cite[\S~10]{V20}
\begin{rem} \label{rem:conj-action}
Unwinding the definitions, we see that the commutativity of~\eqref{eq:conj-pis} is equivalent to the following condition: for every $g\in \St(\Phi, R_S)$ there exists an element $s_g\in S$ and a homomorphism $c_g \colon \St(\Phi, s_g R) \to \St(\Phi, R)$ such that $\lambda_S(c_g(x)) = g \cdot \lambda_S(i(x))\cdot g^{-1}$ for all $x\in \St(\Phi, s_g R)$. Here $i$ denotes the homomorphism $\St(\Phi, s_g R) \to \St(\Phi, R)$ induced by the obvious embedding $s_gR \hookrightarrow R$. The element $s_g$ and the homomorphism $c_g$ can be determined via the following procedure: choose a representative $\eta$ for the morphism $conj(g)$ and set $s_g := \eta^*(1)$ and $c_g := \eta_1$ (the degree $1$ component of $\eta$).
\end{rem}

\begin{rem} \label{rem:conj-root-action}
 Notice also that the root subgroup morphisms $x_\alpha \colon R^{(\infty)} \to \St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R)$ satisfy the identity $conj(x_\alpha(u)) \circ x_\alpha = x_\alpha$ for any $u \in R_S$.
\end{rem}

We also need to study basic functoriality properties of the above construction.
Let $R, R'$ be a pair of domains, $S \subseteq R$, $S' \subseteq R'$ be a pair of multiplicative subsets and let $f \colon R \to R'$ be a homomorphism such that $f(S)\subseteq S'$.
It is clear that $f$ induces a ring homomorphism $\overline{f}\colon R_S \to R'_{S'}$, we also reuse the notation $\overline{f}$ for the induced homomorphism of Steinberg groups.
Now suppose that there is a map $f^* \colon S' \to S$ such that $t$ divides $f(f^*(t))$ for all $t \in S'$ (without loss of generality, we may assume that $f^*(1)=1$ ). The latter condition means, in particular, that $R'_{f(S)} \cong R'_{S'}$. We claim that $f^*$ and the homomorphisms $\{f^*(t)R \to tR'\}_{t\in S'}$ obtained from $f$ by restricting its domain and codomain specify a pre-morphism $R^{(\infty)} \to R'^{(\infty)}$. We denote by $f^{(\infty)}$ the corresponding morphism of pro-rngs and also use the same notation for the induced morphism of Steinberg pro-groups.

\begin{prop} \label{prop:functoriality}
 The action $conj$ constructed in Proposition~\ref{prop:conj-action} has the additional property that the following diagram commutes for every $g \in \St(\Phi, R_S)$:
 \begin{equation} \label{eq:conj-finfty} \begin{tikzcd} \St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R) \ar{r}{conj(g)} \ar{d}{f^{(\infty)}} & \St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R) \ar{d}{f^{(\infty)}} \\ \St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R') \ar{r}{conj(\overline{f}(g))} & \St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R'). \end{tikzcd} \end{equation}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
As before, we may suppose that \(g = x_\alpha(a/s)\) for some \(\alpha \in \Phi\), \(a \in R\), \(s \in S\). By \cite[Lemma~3.2]{LSV20} %TODO: and \cite[Lemma~11]{V20}
it suffices to check that the long paths in the diagram coincide after precomposition with \(x_\beta \colon R^{(\infty)} \to \St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R)\) for all \(\beta \neq -\alpha\). This follows from the definition before~\cite[Proposition~4.2]{LSV20} %TODO: \cite[\S 10]{V20}
and the commutativity of
\[\begin{tikzcd}
R^{(\infty)} \ar{r}{x_\beta} \ar{d}{f^{(\infty)}} &
\St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R) \ar{d}{f^{(\infty)}} \\
{R'}^{(\infty)} \ar{r}{x_\beta} & \St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, R'). \end{tikzcd}\]
\end{proof}

\begin{rem} \label{rem:functoriality}
 Unwinding the definitions, we obtain from the commutativity of~\eqref{eq:conj-finfty} that for every $g \in \St(\Phi, R_S)$ there exists $s_0 \in S$ such that the following diagram commutes:
 \[ \begin{tikzcd} \St(\Phi, s_0R) \ar{r} \ar{d} & \St(\Phi, s_g R) \ar{r}{c_{g}} & \St(\Phi, R) \ar{dd}{f} \\
                   \St(\Phi, f^*(s_{\overline{f}(g)})R) \ar{d}{f}   & & \\
                   \St(\Phi, s_{\overline{f}(g)} R')   \ar{rr}{c_{\overline{f}(g)}} & & \St(\Phi, R'). \end{tikzcd} \]
 In the above diagram $s_g$, $s_{\overline{f}(g)}$, $c_g$, $c_{\overline{f}(g)}$ have the same meaning as in Remark~\ref{rem:conj-action}.
\end{rem}

Now let us specialize the above results to a particular situation that we will encounter in~\cref{sec:proof-glueing}.
Let $\iota \colon B \to A$ be an injective homomorphism of integral domains and $h \neq 0$ be an element of $B$.
We denote by $\mathbb N$ the set of nonnegative integers. Denote by $h^{\mathbb{N}}$ the multiplicative subset $\{ h^n \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \} \subseteq B$. The pro-rng $B^{(\infty)}$ associated to $h^\mathbb{N}$ can be depicted of as the following diagram of rngs (by definition, $B^{(k)}$ is the principal ideal $h^kB$ and all the structure morphisms of $B^{(\infty)}$ are obvious inclusions):
\[ \ldots \hookrightarrow h^{n+1} B \hookrightarrow h^n B \hookrightarrow \ldots \hookrightarrow hB \hookrightarrow B. \]
 
Cosnider the multiplicative subset $\iota(h)^\mathbb{N} \subseteq A$ and the corresponding homomorphism of localizations $\overline{\iota} \colon B_h \to A_{\iota(h)}$. It is clear that if we put $\iota^*(\iota(h)^n) = h^n$, the subsets $h^\mathbb{N} \subseteq B$, $\iota(h)^\mathbb{N} \subseteq A$, and the homomorphism $\iota$ satisfy the requirements mentioned before Proposition~\ref{prop:functoriality}. Thus, there exists a morphism $\iota^{(\infty)}$ of pro-rngs $B^{(\infty)} \to A^{(\infty)}$ and the corresponding morphism of Steinberg pro-groups $\iota^{(\infty)}\colon\St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, B) \to \St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, A)$ satisfying the conclusion of Proposition~\ref{prop:functoriality}.


%Let $f \colon B \to A$ be a homomorphism of integral domains and let $h$ be an element of $B$ such that $f(h)\neq 0$.
%We denote by \(\mathbb N\) the set of nonnegative integers.
%Consider the multiplicative subsets $h^{\mathbb{N}} = \{ h^n \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \} \subset B$ and $f(h)^\mathbb{N} \subseteq A$ and the corresponding homorphism of localizations $\overline{f} \colon B_h \to A_{f(h)}$.
%It is clear that $h^\mathbb{N} \subseteq B$ and $f(h)^\mathbb{N} \subseteq A$ and $f$ satisfy the requirements mentioned before Proposition~\ref{prop:functoriality} (e.\,g. $f^*(f(h)^n) = h^n$), so there exists a morphism $f^{(\infty)}$ of pro-rngs $B^{(\infty)} \to A^{(\infty)}$ and the corresponding morphism of Steinberg pro-groups $f^{(\infty)}\colon\St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, B) \to \St^{(\infty)}(\Phi, A)$ satisfying the conclusion of Proposition~\ref{prop:functoriality}.

\begin{corollary}
\label{vorcor}
For $\iota \colon B \to A$ and $h \in B$ as above and every $g \in \St(\Phi, B_h)$ there exists $n = n(g) \in \mathbb{N}$ 
and group homomorphisms $c_g \colon \St(\Phi, h^nB) \to \St(\Phi, B)$, $c_{\overline{\iota}(g)} \colon \St(\Phi, \iota(h)^nA) \to \St(\Phi, A)$
such that the following equalities are fulfilled:
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:coherence} \iota \circ c_g &= c_{\overline{\iota}(g)} \circ \iota, &\\
 \label{eq:strictB} \lambda_h^0 (c_g (x)) &= g \cdot \lambda_h^n(x) \cdot g^{-1}&\text{ for }x \in \St(\Phi, h^nB),\\
 \label{eq:strictA} \lambda_h^0 (c_{\overline{\iota}(g)}(y)) &= g \cdot \lambda_h^n(y) \cdot \overline{\iota}(g)^{-1}&\text{ for }y \in \St(\Phi, \iota(h)^nA).
\end{align}
Here $\lambda_h^k$ (resp. $\lambda^k_{\iota(h)}$) denotes the homomorphism of Steinberg grops induced by the following composite rng homomorphism $h^kB \hookrightarrow B \to B_h$ (resp. $\iota(h)^kA \hookrightarrow A \to A_{\iota(h)}$), where $k \in \mathbb{N}$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
 The first equality is a special case of the commutativity of the diagram from Remark~\ref{rem:functoriality}.
 The second and the third equalities follow from the equality discussed in Remark~\ref{rem:conj-action}.
\end{proof}
\begin{rem}\label{rem:indendepence}
 Notice that a priori the homomorphism $c_g$ depends on the choice of a representative for $conj(g)$. On the other hand, from the definition of equivalence of pre-morphisms it follows that if $c'_g$ is the degree $1$ component for a different representative of $conj(g)$ then for sufficiently large $m$ one has $c'_{\overline{\iota}(g)}(x_{\alpha}(ah^m)) = c_{\overline{\iota}(g)}(x_{\alpha}(ah^m))$.
\end{rem}

\subsection{Proof of Theorem~\ref{glueing}} \label{sec:proof-glueing}
%It is well known that subgroup factorizations of $\mathrm G(\Phi,\,R)$ are an important ingredient in the study of the $\K_1$-functor. It turns out that in the study of $\K_2$-functors the $\St(\Phi,\,R)$-torsors play similar role, see~\cite{LS20}. TODO:

We let $\St(\Phi, B)$ act on $\St(\Phi, B_h) \times \St(\Phi, A)$ on the left via the formula 
\[w \star (u, v) = (u \lambda_h(w)^{-1}, \iota(w) v),\text{ where }w \in \St(\Phi, B),\ u \in \St(\Phi, B_h),\ v \in \St(\Phi, A).\]
Denote by $V$ the orbit set for this action. We use the notation $[u, v]$ for the orbit corresponding to a pair $(u, v) \in \St(\Phi, B_h) \times \St(\Phi, A)$.

Our goal is to show that the formula $[u, v] \mapsto \overline{\iota}(u) \cdot \lambda_{\iota(h)}(v)$ defines a bijection between $V$ and $\St(\Phi, A_{\iota(h)})$. The first step in this direction is to construct an action of $\St(\Phi, A_{\iota(h)})$ on $V$. 

Fix some $u \in \St(\Phi, B_h)$, $v \in \St(\Phi, A)$, $\alpha \in \Phi$, and $c/{h^s} \in A_{\iota(h)}$.
Applying \cref{vorcor} to the element $u$ we obtain a natural number $n=n(u)$ and homomorphisms \begin{equation} \label{eq:c-homs} c_{u^{-1}}\colon \St(\Phi, h^nB) \to \St(\Phi, B),\ c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})}\colon \St(\Phi, \iota(h)^nA) \to \St(\Phi, A)\end{equation}
satisfying the identities listed in~\cref{vorcor}.

Observe that the assumption $A/hA = B/hB$ is equivalent to the condition that for every $k \geq 0$ one has $A = Ah^k + B$ and $Ah^k \cap B = Bh^k$. Now choose any $k \geq n + s$ and decompose $c \in A$ as
 \begin{equation} \label{eq:decomp} c = ah^k + b\text{ for some }a \in A,\ b \in B. \end{equation}
We define the operator $T_\alpha(c/h^s) \colon V \to V$ via the formula:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:generator-action}
\textstyle
T_\alpha(c/{h^s}) \cdot [u, v] = \bigl[x_\alpha(b/{h^s})\cdot u,\ c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})}(x_\alpha(ah^{k - s})) \cdot v\bigr].
\end{equation}
\begin{lemma}\label{well-def}
The right hand side of~\eqref{eq:generator-action} is independent of either the choice of the decomposition~\eqref{eq:decomp}, the choice of representatives for the morphisms $conj(u)$, $conj(\overline{\iota}(u))$ or the choice of a representative for the orbit $[u, v]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
First, let us show the independence of the choice of a decomposition for $c$. 
Choose some $l \geq n + s$ and $c = a' h^{l} + b'$. Without loss of generality, we may assume $l \leq k$ so that $a' h^{l} - a h^k = b - b' \in Ah^{l} \cap B = Bh^{l}$ and there exists $d \in B$ such that $b = b' + dh^{l}$. Thus, from~\eqref{eq:strictB} we obtain that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:wd1} \textstyle x_\alpha(b/{h^s})\, u = x_\alpha({b'}/{h^s})\, u \cdot u^{-1}\, x_\alpha(dh^{l-s})\, u =  x_\alpha({b'}/{h^s})\, u \cdot \lambda_h \bigl(c_{u^{-1}}(x_\alpha(dh^{l-s}))\bigr). \end{equation}
Since $a'h^l = ah^k + dh^l$ and $A$ is a domain we obtain that $a'h^{l-s} = dh^{l-s} + ah^{k-s}$ therefore
\begin{align*}
[x_\alpha(b'/{h^s})\, u,\ c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})}(x_\alpha(a'h^{l - s}))\, v\bigr] = \bigl[x_\alpha(b'/{h^s})\, u,\ \iota\bigl(c_{u^{-1}}(x_\alpha(dh^{l-s}))\bigr)\, c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})}(x_\alpha(ah^{k - s}))\, v\bigr] & \text{ by~\eqref{eq:coherence}} \\ = \bigl[x_\alpha(b/{h^s})\, u,\ c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})}(x_\alpha(ah^{k - s}))\, v\bigr] &\text{ by~\eqref{eq:wd1},}
\end{align*}
 which coincides with the right-hand side of~\eqref{eq:generator-action}.

The independence of the right-hand side of~\eqref{eq:generator-action} of the choice of representatives for $conj(g)$ and $conj(\overline{\iota}(g))$ follows from Remark~\ref{rem:indendepence} and the fact that the number $k$ in the decomposition for $c$ could have been chosen arbitrarily large.

Now suppose that $(u', v')$ is another representative for the orbit $[u, v]$, i.\,e. $u' = u \cdot \lambda_h(w)$, $v' = \iota(w^{-1})\cdot v$ for some $w \in \St(\Phi,\,B)$. It is clear that we can choose a representative $\eta$ for $conj(\overline{\iota}(\lambda_h(w^{-1})))$ in such a way that $\eta^*(1)=1$ and its first-degree component $\eta_1 \colon \St(\Phi, A) \to \St(\Phi, A)$ coincides with $h \mapsto \iota(w^{-1}) \cdot h \cdot \iota(w)$, moreover, from the definition of the composition of pre-morphisms we conclude that $c_{\overline{\iota}({u'}^{-1})} =  \eta_1 \circ c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})} $. The independence of~\eqref{eq:generator-action} of the choice of $(u, v)$ now follows from the following direct calculation:
\begin{multline*}
 [x_\alpha(b/h^s) \cdot u',\ c_{\overline{\iota}({u'}^{-1})}(x_\alpha(ah^{k-s}))\cdot v'] = [x_\alpha(b/h^s) \cdot u \cdot \lambda_h(w),\ c_{\overline{\iota}({u'}^{-1})}(x_\alpha(ah^{k-s}))\cdot \iota(w^{-1}) v] = \\
 = [x_\alpha(b/h^s) \cdot u \cdot \lambda_h(w),\ \iota(w) \cdot c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})}(x_\alpha(ah^{k-s}))\cdot v] 
 = [x_\alpha(b/h^s) \cdot u,\ c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})}(x_\alpha(ah^{k-s}))\cdot v]. \qedhere
\end{multline*}
\end{proof}

The next step of the proof is to verify that the above action specifies an action of $\St(\Phi, A_{\iota(h)})$ on $V$.
This is accomplished in the series of lemmas below:

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:R1} The operators $T_\alpha$ satisfy relations~\eqref{R1}. \end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We need to show that for $c, c' \in A$ one has $\textstyle
T_\alpha(c'/{h^s}) \cdot T_\alpha(c/h^s) \cdot [u, v] = T_\alpha\bigl((c+c')/h^s\bigr) \cdot [u, v].$
Choose a decomposition $c = ah^k + b$ as in~\eqref{eq:decomp} for some $k \geq n(u) + s$.
We claim that there exists a sufficiently large number $m$ such that $c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1}) \cdot x_\alpha(-b/h^s)}(x_\alpha(a'h^{m-s})) = c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})}(x_\alpha(a'h^{m-s}))$ for all $a'\in A$. Indeed, this follows from the definition of the composition of pre-morphisms and Remark~\ref{rem:conj-root-action}. 
Now choose a decomposition $c' = a' h^m + b'$.
The assertion now follows from the following calculation:
\begin{multline*}
 T_\alpha(c'/{h^s}) \cdot T_\alpha(c/h^s) \cdot [u,\ v] = T_\alpha(c'/h^s) \cdot [x_\alpha(b/h^s)\cdot u,\ c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})}(x_\alpha(ah^{k-s})) \cdot v] = \\
 = [x_\alpha((b + b')/h^s)\cdot u,\ c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1}) \cdot x_\alpha(-b/h^s)}(x_\alpha(a'h^{m-s})) \cdot c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})}(x_\alpha(ah^{k-s})) \cdot v] = \\ = [x_\alpha((b + b')/h^s)\cdot u,\  c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})}(x_\alpha(a'h^{m-s} + ah^{k-s})) \cdot v] = T_\alpha\bigl((c+c')/h^s\bigr) \cdot [u, v]. \qedhere
\end{multline*}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:R3-check} The operators $T_\alpha$ satisfy relations~\eqref{R3}. \end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
 Fix a natural number $s$ and a pair of roots $\alpha, \beta \in \Phi$ such that $\alpha+\beta\in\Phi$. Set $\epsilon = N_{\alpha, \beta}$. From the definition of composition of pro-group morphisms and the definition of $conj$ it follows that for any $u \in \St(\Phi, B_h)$ there exists sufficiently large natural number $n$ such that for all $a \in A$, $b, b'\in B$ the following equalities are simultaneously fulfilled:
 \begin{align}
 c_{ \overline{\iota}((x_\beta(b/h^s) \cdot u)^{-1})}(x_\alpha(ah^{n-s})) &= c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})}\left(x_\alpha(ah^{n-s}) \cdot x_{\alpha+\beta}(\epsilon ab h^{n-2s})\right), \label{eq:R3-check-1}\\
 c_{ \overline{\iota}((x_\alpha(b/h^s) \cdot u)^{-1})}(x_\beta(ah^{n - s})) &= c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})}\bigl(x_{\alpha + \beta}(-\epsilon abh^{n - 2s})\cdot x_\beta(ah^{n - s})\bigr), \label{eq:R3-check-2} \\
 c_{ \overline{\iota}((x_\beta(b'/h^s) \cdot x_\alpha(b/h^s) \cdot u)^{-1})}\bigl(x_{\alpha + \beta}\bigl(a h^{n - 2s}\bigr)\bigr) &= c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})}\bigl(x_{\alpha + \beta}\bigl(a h^{n - 2s}\bigr)\bigr). \label{eq:R3-check-3}
 \end{align} 
Now fix $c, c\in A$. Our goal is to verify the equality 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:R3-to-check} T_\alpha(c/h^s) \cdot T_\beta(c'/h^s) \cdot [u, v] = T_{\alpha+\beta}(\epsilon cc' / h^{2s}) \cdot T_\beta(c'/h^s) \cdot T_\alpha(c/h^s) \cdot [u, v].\end{equation}
As in~\eqref{eq:decomp} we can choose decompositions $c = b + ah^n,\ c' = b' + a'h^n$ for some $a, a' \in A$ and $b, b' \in B$. It is also clear that $cc' = bb' + h^{n}a''$, where $a'' = aa'h^n + ab' + a'b$. Now we can compute the left-hand side of~\eqref{eq:R3-to-check} using~\eqref{eq:generator-action} and~\eqref{eq:R3-check-1} as follows:
\begin{multline*}
 T_\alpha(c/h^s) \cdot T_\beta(c'/h^s) \cdot [u, v] = T_\alpha(c/h^s) \cdot [x_\beta(b'/h^s) \cdot u,\ c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})}(x_\beta(a'h^{n-s})) \cdot v] = \\ = [x_\alpha(b/h^s) \cdot x_\beta(b'/h^s) \cdot u, c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})}(x_\alpha(ah^{n-s}) \cdot x_{\alpha+\beta}(\epsilon ab'h^{n-2s}) \cdot x_\beta(a'h^{n-s}))]. \end{multline*}
Similarly, we can compute the right-hand side of~\eqref{eq:R3-to-check} using~\eqref{eq:generator-action} and~\eqref{eq:R3-check-2}--\eqref{eq:R3-check-3}:
\begin{multline*}
 T_{\alpha+\beta}(\epsilon cc'/h^{2s}) \cdot T_\beta(c'/h^s) \cdot T_\alpha(c/h^s) \cdot [u, v] = \\ = [x_{\alpha+\beta}(\epsilon bb'/h^{2s}) \cdot x_\beta(b'/h^s) \cdot x_\alpha(b/h^s) \cdot u, c_{\overline{\iota}(u^{-1})}(x_{\alpha+\beta}(\epsilon h^{n-2s}(a''- a'b)) \cdot x_\beta(a'h^{n-s}) \cdot x_\alpha(ah^{n-s}))]. \end{multline*}
Finally, it follows from~\eqref{R3} that the right-hand sides of the last two formulae coincide.
\end{proof}

\begin{comment}
\begin{lemma} The operators $T_\alpha$ satisfy relations~\eqref{R4}. \end{lemma}
The lase case is $\alpha + \beta, \alpha + 2\beta \in \Phi$ and $2\alpha + \beta \notin \Phi$. We show that
$$\textstyle
f = x_\alpha(\frac c {h^s})\, x_\beta(\frac{c'}{h^s})
\text{ and }
g = x_{\alpha + 2\beta}(N_{\alpha \beta 1 2} \frac{c {c'}^2}{h^{3s}})\, x_{\alpha + \beta}(N_{\alpha \beta} \frac{cc'}{h^{2s}})\, x_\beta(\frac{c'}{h^s})\, x_\alpha(\frac c {h^s})
$$ 
act identically on $V$. Choose decompositions $c = ah^n + b$, $c' = a'h^n + b'$, $cc' = (aa' h^n + ab' + a'b) h^n + bb'$, and $c{c'}^2 = (a{a'}^2 h^{2n} + 2aa'b' h^n + {a'}^2 b h^n + 2a'bb' + a{b'}^2) h^n + b{b'}^2$ for sufficiently large $n$.
Then
$$\textstyle
f\,(u, v) = \bigl(x_\alpha(\frac b {h^s})\, x_\beta(\frac{b'}{h^s})\, u,
\theta'_0(x_\alpha(ah^{n - s}))\, \theta_0(x_\beta(a'h^{n - s}))\, v\bigr),
$$
where $\theta$ is a strict representative of $\Xi(\iota(u))^{-1}$ and $\theta'$ is a strict representative of $\Xi(x_\beta(\frac{b'}{h^s})\, \iota(u))^{-1}$. It is possible to choose $\theta'$ in such a way that
$$
\theta'_0(x_\alpha(ah^{n - s})) = \theta_0\bigl(x_\alpha(ah^{n - s})\, x_{\alpha + \beta}(N_{\alpha\beta} ab'h^{n - 2s})\, x_{\alpha + 2\beta}(-N_{\alpha\beta 12} a{b'}^2 h^{n - 3s})\bigr).
$$
Next, 
\begin{multline*}\textstyle
g\, (u, v) = \bigl(x_{\alpha + 2\beta}(N_{\alpha \beta 12} \frac{b{b'}^2}{h^{3s}})\, x_{\alpha+\beta}(N_{\alpha \beta} \frac{bb'}{h^{2s}})\, x_\beta(\frac{b'}{h^s})\, x_\alpha(\frac b {h^s})\, u,\\
\theta^{\mathrm{IV}}_0\bigl(x_{\alpha + 2\beta}(N_{\alpha \beta 12} (a{a'}^2 h^{2n} + 2aa'b' h^n + {a'}^2 b h^n + 2a'bb' + a{b'}^2) h^{n - 3s})\bigr)\\
\theta'''_0\bigl(x_{\alpha + \beta}\bigl(N_{\alpha \beta} (aa' h^n + ab' + a'b) h^{n - 2s}\bigr)\bigr)\, \theta''_0(x_\beta(a'h^{n-s}))\, \theta_0(x_\alpha(ah^{n - s}))\, v\bigr),
\end{multline*}
where $\theta''$ is a strict representative of $\Xi\bigl(x_\alpha(\frac b {h^s})\, \iota(u)\bigr)^{-1}$, $\theta'''$ is a strict representative of $\Xi\bigl(x_\beta(\frac{b'}{h^s})\, x_\alpha(\frac b{h^s})\, \iota(u)\bigr)^{-1}$, and $\theta^{\mathrm{IV}}$ is a strict representative of $\Xi\bigl(x_{\alpha + \beta}(N_{\alpha \beta}\frac{bb'}{h^{2s}})\, x_\beta(\frac{b'}{h^s})\, x_\alpha(\frac b{h^s})\, \iota(u)\bigr)^{-1}$. We may choose $\theta''$, $\theta'''$, $\theta^{\mathrm{IV}}$ in such a way that
$$
\theta''_0(x_\beta(a' h^{n - s})) = \theta_0\bigl(x_{\alpha + 2\beta}(-N_{\alpha \beta 1 2} {a'}^2 bh^{2n - 3s})\, x_{\alpha + \beta}(-N_{\alpha \beta} a'bh^{n - 2s})\, x_\beta(a'h^{n - s})\bigr),
$$
\begin{multline*}
\theta'''_0\bigl(x_{\alpha + \beta}\bigl(N_{\alpha \beta} (aa'h^n + ab' + a'b) h^{n - 2s}\bigr)\bigr)\\
= \theta_0\bigl(x_{\alpha + 2\beta}(-N_{\beta, \alpha + \beta} N_{\alpha \beta} (aa'h^n + ab' + a'b) b' h^{n - 3s})\, x_{\alpha + \beta}\bigl(N_{\alpha \beta} (aa'h^n + ab' + a'b) h^{n - 2s}\bigr)\bigr),
\end{multline*}
and
\begin{multline*}
\theta^{\mathrm{IV}}_0\bigl(x_{\alpha + 2\beta}(N_{\alpha \beta 12} (a{a'}^2 h^{2n} + 2aa'b' h^n + {a'}^2 bh^n + 2a'bb' + a{b'}^2) h^{n - 3s})\bigr)\\
= \theta_0\bigl(x_{\alpha + 2\beta}(N_{\alpha \beta 12} (a{a'}^2 h^{2n} + 2aa'b' + {a'}^2 bh^n + 2a'bb' + a{b'}^2) h^{n - 3s})\bigr).
\end{multline*}
It remains to check that
\begin{multline*}
x_\alpha(ah^{n - s})\, x_{\alpha + \beta}(N_{\alpha\beta} ab'h^{n - 2s})\, x_{\alpha + 2\beta}(-N_{\alpha\beta 12} a{b'}^2 h^{n - 3s})\, x_\beta(a' h^{n - s})\\
= x_{\alpha + 2\beta}(N_{\alpha \beta 12} (a{a'}^2 h^{2n} + 2aa'b' h^n + 2a'bb' + a{b'}^2) h^{n - 3s} - N_{\beta, \alpha + \beta} N_{\alpha \beta} (aa'h^n + ab' + a'b) b' h^{n - 3s})\\
x_{\alpha + \beta}\bigl(N_{\alpha \beta} (aa'h^n + ab' + a'b) h^{n - 2s}\bigr)\, x_{\alpha + \beta}(-N_{\alpha \beta} a'bh^{n - 2s})\, x_\beta(a'h^{n - s})\, x_\alpha(ah^{n - s}).
\end{multline*}
This follows from the Steinberg relations and the identity \(N_{\beta, \alpha + \beta} N_{\alpha \beta} = 2 N_{\alpha \beta 1 2}\).
\end{comment} 
The proof of the fact that $T_\alpha$ satisfy relations~\eqref{R2} is similar to the proof of the above lemmas but is easier, so we leave it as an exercise to the reader.

It follows that the action of $\St(\Phi, A_{\iota(h)})$ on $V$ is well-defined. By construction, the canonical map \(V \to \St(\Phi, A_{\iota(h)})\) preserves the action, where \(\St(\Phi, A_{\iota(h)})\) acts on itself by left multiplication. Since \((1, 1) \in V\) maps to \(1 \in \St(\Phi, A_{\iota(h)})\), it remains to check the transitivity of the action on \(V\). But the construction implies that \((u, v) = \iota(u)\, \bigl(\lambda_h(v)\, (1, 1)\bigr)\). Thus, \(V \to \St(\Phi, A_{\iota(h)})\) is a bijection.
Now if \(u \in \St(\Phi, B_h)\) and \(v \in \St(\Phi, A)\) are such that \(\iota(u) = \lambda_h(v)\), the class of \((u, v^{-1})\) in \(V\) maps to \(1 \in \St(\Phi, A_{\iota(h)})\). Thus, \([u, v^{-1}] = [1, 1]\) and $u = \lambda_h(w)$, $v = \iota(w)$ for some $w \in \St(\Phi, B)$, which completes the proof of the assertion of Theorem~\ref{glueing} for Steinberg groups. Since $\iota\colon \Gsc(\Phi, B)\to \Gsc(\Phi, A)$ is injective, we also obtain the assertion for $\K_2(\Phi, -)$.
